# Stack Battle Royale

A Java simulation built for my Data Structures course (0145-273-001, Professor Vitale).  
Uses stacks to simulate players pushing and popping disks from three stacks.

## Features
- Three shared stacks (A, B, C)
- Scheduled pops (A: every 3rd, B: 7th, C: 8th)
- Random player turns
- Custom end message: "Haaziq Out"

## Run in BlueJ or with:
```bash
javac *.java
java StackBattleRoyale
